# Pillars Project: Notes & FAQ

## Notes

### What is on it?

Express + Sequelize. Check the Slack for details.

### How is it graded?

Your final score will be calculated as follows:

- Requirements score (75%)
- Rubric score (25%)
- Extra credit (+10% max)

**Requirements** are human-readable, "plain English", descriptions of features you are required to build. _They are not test specs_.

The **Rubric** is about code style, clarity, and best practices.

NOTE: There are **test specs** included in this project. However, they are not graded. The test specs exist to serve as guidance to help you with the requirements (if you are passing a test spec, you are probably passing the requirement). If you complete a requirement but do not pass the test spec, you will still receive full credit.

### There is a README. **READ THE README** before starting

### There is an introduction video. **WATCH THE INTRO VIDEO** before starting

This is linked at the very top of the README.


## FAQ

### Can you look at your own previous solution code?

Yes! Any code from _either_ the cohort repo, or your own repos is allowed.

### As long as we pass all the test specs, can we think that we will get all of requirement points?

While there's not an _exact_ 1:1 matching between test specs and feature requirements, you can be sure that passing all the test specs will most likely yield a very high score on the requirements. Completing the test specs is a good sign that you probably _also_ completed the requirements! But just to be sure - still look at the requirements file, run through the list, and make sure you've done everything listed.

### Is pillars as long as the other checkpoints?

How long Pillars takes you to complete will vary based on your personal comfort with the material _at the present moment_. Someone who is very confident with all the material thus far will likely complete Pillars within the time allotted, maybe a little early! If you're someone who is feeling _mostly there_, but still some areas you're shaky on, it may take you the full day to complete, or you may find you run out of time on and do not complete everything. If you feel that you're middle-of-the-road on material so far, you may not complete Pillars, and that's ok too. And if you're struggling right now and don't get too far in Pillars, that's also ok.

***Your score on Pillars will not affect your standing in the program.*** If you do great on Pillars, congrats! However, if you don't do as well as you'd hoped, or maybe you didn't get far at all - the "worst" that will happen is that we'll reach out to you to schedule some time to help you out. The main goal of Pillars is to give us (and you!) an indication of how you're grasping the material _at this exact moment in time_ - so we'll set up some office hours, help you figure things out, send you resources, etc.

### What grade is considered passing?

This is a hard one to answer because _it depends_. I could say that completing roughly 3/4 of the requirements is a good place to aim for - but what matters, too, is how you wrote that code. Were all the requirements you completed for Express, and you skipped Sequelize? Or was it a healthy mix of both? Did you complete many requirements, but they were not following best practices?

Your instructional staff will be looking at many, many factors about your code to try to get a fully picture of how you're doing. Everyone is unique :)

### What is the rough draft submission on the calendar? (at break time)

This is a reminder to PUSH YOUR CODE to Github! You should be committing and pushing often - good code hygiene is also good git hygiene!

### Is today's topic included? (SPA, AJAX)

You will not be assessed on today's topics, but you will see them in the project. The Pillars project is a fully functioning app that you can run, and click around! In order to have that, some AJAX was used.

### Is DOM manipulation on it?

In the **requirements**, there is just Express and Sequelize related material. There will be no requirements on things like DOM manipulation, CSS, raw SQL, AJAX, etc. However.... I can neither confirm nor deny that any of these topics may be in the extra credit! :)
